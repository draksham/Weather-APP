# Project: Weather App

## Introduction

Create a weather forecast site using the weather API from the previous lesson. The app allows users to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius. Change the look of the page based on the weather data, such as adjusting the background color or adding relevant images. You may even use the Giphy API to find and display appropriate weather-related gifs. Feel free to use promises or async/await in your code.
